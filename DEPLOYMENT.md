# Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment

### Quick Update
1. **Replace the file**: Upload the new `index.html` to your repository
2. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Update to ASCII 3D Forest with enhanced atmosphere"`
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
4. **Wait**: GitHub Pages will automatically deploy in 2-5 minutes

### What's New in This Version
- **Forest Environment**: Procedurally generated forest with realistic trees
- **Higher Resolution**: 160Ã—60 characters (up from 120Ã—40)
- **Advanced Rendering**: Ray-circle tree intersection for smooth trunks
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Dappled lighting, wind, distance fog, falling leaves
- **Enhanced Performance**: Spatial hashing and adaptive quality scaling

### File Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main game file (self-contained)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Updated documentation
â””â”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT.md      # This file
```

### Verification
After deployment, verify:
- âœ… Forest loads with trees and atmospheric effects
- âœ… Movement works smoothly (WASD + arrows)
- âœ… Performance maintains 30+ FPS
- âœ… Debug overlay shows 160Ã—60 resolution (F1)
- âœ… Help screen displays correctly (?)

### Rollback
If issues occur, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting to the previous commit
2. Or replacing with `ascii-3d-room.html` (original room version)

### Performance Notes
- **Desktop**: Full 160Ã—60 resolution
- **Mobile**: May auto-scale to 120Ã—40 for performance
- **Low-end devices**: Will adaptively reduce resolution as needed

The forest environment is significantly more complex than the original room but maintains the same performance targets through optimized algorithms.
